For short, we say \"papply\" instead of \"partially apply\". After you papply one argument to a function, you get another function that accepts the rest of the arguments and outputs the result. Papply is available in the library \"functools\" as \"functools.partial\". Here I import it a \"papply\" since that's what we'll refer to it as."
